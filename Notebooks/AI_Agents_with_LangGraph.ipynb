Khan is generally described as a Pakistani nationalist,[127] as well as a populist.[128] Khan\\'s proclaimed political platform and declarations include Islamic values, to which he rededicated himself in the 1990s; liberal economics, with the promise of deregulating the economy and creating a welfare state; decreased bureaucracy and the implementation of anti-corruption laws to create and ensure a clean government; the establishment of an independent judiciary; overhaul of the country\\'s police system; and an anti-militant vision for a democratic Pakistan.[129][101][130][131]\\nAfter the result of 2018 Pakistani general election, Khan said he would try to remake Pakistan based on the ideology of Muhammad Ali Jinnah.[132] Further efforts to combat climate change consisted of re-foresting Pakistan with over 10\\xa0billion trees under the Plant for Pakistan project[336][337] with the government on course to plant 3.3\\xa0billion trees in the first three and a half years of Khan\\'s government, the reforestation programme includes an agreement with the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and others to independently monitor the projects in order to maintain transparency about funding.[338] Khan also expanded national parks under a protected areas initiative.[339]\\nGovernance and anti-corruption\\nKhan\\'s government introduced reforms to Pakistan\\'s bloated public sector.[340][341] The public sector consisted of state-owned enterprises that were consistently making losses and accumulating debt for decades, including national services such as railways, airlines, postal services as well as other state-owned companies such as Pakistan\\'s state-owned steel company.'}]"
